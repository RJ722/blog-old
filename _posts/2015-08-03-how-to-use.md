Hello, This post is a brief description of what is GSoC, how I wrote my project proposal for GSoC, and what I
would be working on this summer.

## What exactly is GSoC?

GSoc stands for Google Summer of code. It is an annual programming event which encourages students at University
level to contribute more to open source. A student gets many perks if he successfully completes his/her project
including:
* **Stipend** (2400 USD for three months in India) - quite a big deal.
* Referrals when you apply for a job at Google.
* Contacts with programmers round the world.
* A kickstart guide which motivates you to get started on open source development.

Thank You!
