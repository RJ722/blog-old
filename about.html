<p>
	I am a sophomore at <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/principal.jsp?did=10147">Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology</a>, studying Electronics Engineering. I advocate the principles of FLOSS (Free and Libre Open Source Software) and therefore, along with some seniors, I co-founded an open source software society at college, AMU-OSS, which helps more and more people contribute to upstream software. I am afraid of the risks that online surveillance poses on us and thereby commend safe surfing of the Internet, i.e. at the very least using duckduckgo for search, using torBrowser, etc.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<ul>
<li>
	<b>Robotics</b>
	<p>
		I took up Engineering because of my passion for Autonomous Robots - They fascinate me, leave me overwhelmed every time I realise the complicated intricacies of machinery which empowers our brain and keeps it working.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<b>Working on Open Source Projects</b>
	<p>
		Other than learning/pondering about Robots, I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>, a tool which helps find dead code in Python Programs, and <a href="coala.io">coala</a>, a language independent static analysis tool and a linter. I was selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5154725527814144/">Google Summer of Code student</a> with coala in 2017, which was indeed a great experience. I believe that pursuing open source is one of the best ways I can give back to the society, teaching what I learned from it. I always welcome people who write emails to me about how to get started with contributing to OSS projects, if you too feel like that you need a push, write to me straight away at (<a href="malito:rahul@rj722.tech">rahul [AT] rj722 [DOT] tech</a>)
	</p>
</li>

<li>
	<b>Reading</b>
	<p>
		I like to learn new things, be it anything, and that is why I read, a lot about tech and yet more about the open soure movement and poetry. I want to start reading literature.
	</p>
</li>

<li>
	<b><b>Not</b> using (i.e. not getting used) by facebook</b>
	<p>
		I didn't appreciate facebook back when I was a kid, particularly because it was very addicting and I gained nothing from it - ended up reading jokes or laughing at someone else's very old pics. It appeared to be a huge waste of time so I stopped using it.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a grown up, I don't like it either, but for a different reason - The amount of information they track (without my  consent) is huge and I believe that this (subconsciously ) changes my behavior online, which is certainly not acceptable nor preferable. I am particularly pointing towards Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Google. My facebook account is a fallback one - I use it <i>only</i> when I have to lookup an event or contacting someone in case of an emergency or similar very rare situations, so if you've sent me a friend request, please be a bit patient as I might not see it immediately.
	</p>

	<p>
		Please refer to <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">https://stallman.org/facebook.html</a> for more reasons on not using (getting used by) facebook.
	</p>
</li>


<li>
	<b>Going to meetups and conferences</b>
	<p>
		I've a ton of fun at conferences - whether I am an attendee or an organizer, either way I get to meet and learn from like minded people. I also host regular meetups through AMU-OSS, where anyone from the audience is welcome to come and speak about whatever she's been working on lately.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wad invited as a speaker in PyCon India 2017 where I spoke about "Reducing Dead Code Ratio of Python Projects using vulture". I also delivered a lightening talk on "coala - What, why and How?" and met quite a few celebrities in the Python community and made a lot of friends during the same conference.
	</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Some of my other hobbies include:
<ul>
	<li> Writing - I update this blog once in a while. I write in my <a href="rahuls-diary.herokuapp.com">diary</a>, much more often.</li>
	<li> Configuring and trying out different themes and desktop environments. </li>
	<li> Gtypist - Learning to touch type </li>
</ul>
