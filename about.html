<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a student currently  pursuing B.Tech  -  Electronics Engineering from  Zakir Husain College of Engineering  and Technology. I started developing in python a couple of  years ago. Also, I  have been selected for the Google Summer
of code 2017 with coala.</p>

<p>I am an open source enthusiast and like to advocate  the principle of freedom to customise the software according to 
one's needs. Apart from this, I like web development  (django and flask). Over time, I have developed an interest in 
testing because tests implicitly reflect how usable the  code is - Is the interface easy to use, or have I cluttered
up too much code - it improves the quality of code greatly by removing this mess and redundancy.</p>

<p>One thing, I personally recommend to everyone is to learn using git (or VCS synonymously). It has such a huge feature 
set, that I wonder has anyone, other than Linus Torvalds, managed to harness its complete functionality. It gives you 
complete hold over your code and using it with a cloud service  like github, gitlab makes collaboration as easy as it 
gets. The course on udacity - How  to use git and Github, The  Git Tutorial, the official git tutorial- They are good 
resources  for  starting to learn basics of git. I also write blog posts for the same. Other than these, the 
documentation of git and github is pretty nice.</p>

<p>When I am not programming, I am generally studying, creative writing, or hanging out with my friends. I like solving 
mathematical problems. I like writing something everyday- I am good at  remembering things, and most importantly  it 
taught me how to be cool with criticism and why should I be happy when I get negative comments!</p>
